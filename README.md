## Content Development

- HTML Content
    - Use sectioning elements to create the document's semantic structure
        - `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `nav`, `aside`
    - Create sample inline content
        - `a`, `strong`, `em`, `button`, etc


    - Determine your `@media` query breakpoints based on your current design
        - Style the layout for one breakpoint as a time (smallest to largest)
        - Consider adding at least two break points
   
    - Use `display: grid` for your layout where required
        - `display: flex` works best for smaller widgets and components, for the most part
        - Review the lesson on "Grid for Layouts" as part of Week 2/3

## Deliverables

The lab will be reviewed/assessed **after all parts are complete**, in the week of the third lesson, on **September 30th, 2020, end of day**.

- Please hold onto all work until instructed to submit (via Github), I will make an announcement in class when the work is to be submit, and how.
